Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork: cloned copy of project on github server. attribute to someone elses work, less steps.

clone: complete copy of project on local machine. seperate work, just using as a shell.

branch: a clone of project within the project. your project you are making changes to.
